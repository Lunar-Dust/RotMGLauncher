# RotMGLauncher
## About
This is just a small project I decided to make because I was sick of always having to resize my flash projector after launching Realm. If you want to make any contributions feel free to make a PR and I'll likely accept it if the code is good and beneficial.

## Installation
In order to run this, you must first run the .exe file. This will create a file called "settings.ini". Open up settings.ini, and enter the path to your Adobe Flash Projector exe. Example:
```
Projector=C:\Users\Rose\Documents\projector.exe
```
After this, simply run the RotMGLauncher again and everything should work!

## Customization
The program is easy to customize. Here's what each bit of the settings.ini does:
- XPosition: Sets the X position of the top left corner of the game window
- YPosition: Sets the Y position of the top left corner of the game window
- Width: Sets the width of the game window in pixels
- Height: Height is calculated automatically based on your width setting, but you can also set it manually
